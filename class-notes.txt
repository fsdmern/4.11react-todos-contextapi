React - Todos with ContextAPI
=========================================
The ContextAPI in react llow every component in the component tree to have access to consume data without having to manually pass props downn from parent to child.

Advantage: To pass data from Level 5 to Level 1, then data has to pass through 4,3 & components which are acting like middle man. Using ContextAPI we can cut these middle man like components
Through this approach only the component that needs the data would about the data.

Design: We will be creating a global data store like mechanism (Provider and Consumer) and then we make sure the data is available to which ever component that requires it.
